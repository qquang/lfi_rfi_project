        It can be said that IT is the king of professions Vietnam's IT industry is now at the forefront of development. It can be said that IT is the king of all the jobs. Both have money, have rights. Just earn a lot of $ and be respected by society. My younger
        brother studied mechanical engineering, dropped out of IT, was born in 96. Self-taught to learn coding and then worked as a remote for an American company for 2 years now. Every night online 3-4 hours is done. Monthly salary 3k6. But the main
        income is still from receiving outside projects. Doing 2 or 3 things a week gently, 9.10k real money, no tax. Working for almost 3 years, the garage has bought all. Think and want. Every chubby girl wants him when he says he is studying IT. There
        was another child, an Australian student, and was introduced by her sister to work as a VCB bank. How did he go to open a credit card and he caught both my sister and me. The three of them live in a luxury apartment. The other girl's family knew
        about the initial objection, then she changed her attitude when she learned that he was studying IT, and asked three times to visit, five times to give gifts to urge her to get married lest she miss the deal. This month was supposed to be their
        wedding, but due to covid, it was postponed to the end of the year.
